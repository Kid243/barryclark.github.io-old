I led a team at [Lean Startup Machine Ultimate][1] this weekend in San Francisco. It&#8217;s a 3 day workshop for entrepreneurs, focused on **getting out of the building** to interview customers, with the goal of rapidly validating (or invalidating) your business idea. Teams are known for using customer learnings to pivot their idea as many as 5 or 6 times over the course of the weekend.<!--more-->

## &#8220;What you&#8217;re doing should feel sketchy&#8221;

Previous LSM winner Mark Abramson explained that the best way to validate demand for your business idea is to have people pay for it. To do this in a weekend **you need to sell your product before the product is actually built**.

There are a few different ways to do this, but it often means pitching the customer implying that you have a product built and then actually taking their money. Getting people to hand over money for your product is by far the strongest way to validate that people will actually pay for your product. This can feel pretty deceitful, but obviously you give them the money back afterwardsâ€”or actually build and provide them with the service that you promised.

## It&#8217;s important to face rejection and failure head on

I spend a lot of time working on startup ideas. Often this work includes sharing ideas with friends, doing competitive analysis or creating a business plan. None of these things involve validating that people actually want what I&#8217;m working on, which is 100x more difficult and much more important.

It&#8217;s easy to stay in the warm cozy bubble of working on my ideas, and sometimes even building the product, giving me the feeling that i&#8217;m making progress. It&#8217;s much more difficult for me to go out and speak with potential customers to find out their pain points and find out if they&#8217;d use my product, because that opens me up to finding out that there&#8217;s no demand for it and the idea is a failure.

**One of my biggest learnings of the weekend is that it&#8217;s incredibly important to face that failure and rejection early. It&#8217;s a lot better than pouring time into working on something that nobody wants.**

## Approaching strangers isn&#8217;t so bad

Initially it was very daunting to approach complete strangers in the street and get them talk about their problems then attempting to sell them a product, but it got easier the more I did it. A number of the people we spoke with loved having someone to spill all of their problems to.

A few tips for tackling initial approach anxiety:

*   Go out with a group, it helps with confidence. (but approach people individually or in pairs so that you don&#8217;t scare them off)
*   Set a target of the amount of people you need to speak within the next hour
*   Give everyone in your group that target, it creates social pressure as you don&#8217;t want to let the group down

## Tactical approaches reap benefits

Some tips that worked really well for us this weekend:

*   People smoking outside are good chat with as they&#8217;re only outside for a few minutes
*   Approach people waiting in lines, for the same reason as above
*   Approaching people who are on the move doesn&#8217;t go well!
*   Get yes&#8217;s early. [Trevor Owen][2] spoke about asking quick, easy questions early on to build rapport quickly and get the interviewee talking to you. 
*   Opening with a disarming line like &#8220;I work for a startup and we&#8217;re doing some research on X&#8230;&#8221; then going immediately into an easy question like &#8220;&#8230;do you shop for clothing for yourself?&#8221; greatly increased our chances of getting a good conversation started.
*   Opening with lines like &#8220;Can I ask you a few questions about X?&#8221; or &#8220;Excuse me, do you have a minute for me to ask you a quick question?&#8221; generally doesn&#8217;t work well with people. 

## Finding our customers was difficult

We were often looking specifically for single, fashion conscious guys in their 20s or 30s. This meant that we&#8217;d have to approach guys and ask early questions to identify if they&#8217;re within our target customer segment, which a lot of the time they weren&#8217;t. This was pretty frustrating and a common difficulty amongst teams. A number of teams had to pivot purely because they had difficulty reaching their customer. It was important to have an idea where we could reach our customers easily.

## Having a narrow customer segment can be good

Initially we started out with a really wide description of our customer, &#8220;guys who disliked shopping for clothes&#8221;. When interviewing customers about their problems we found their answers to be very scattered and varied, without much of a pattern. This made it difficult for us to come up with a solution. With a tighter customer segment like, &#8220;single guys in their 20s who work in a formal environment&#8221; it&#8217;s easier to find a common problem, then shoot directly at a solution for that problem.

## Remote customer interviews for $1 a go

Justin Wilcox from Customer Dev Labs presented on [using Amazon Mechanical Turk for Customer Interviews][3]. We tested this ourselves and it took around 30mins of setup work on Amazon to get multiple inbound calls to our cell phones from customers within the segment we wanted to interview. You can also have customers call a Google Voice number if you don&#8217;t want to give out your cell, there&#8217;s a great call recording option on there too, and it&#8217;s free.

## Mentor advice is invaluable

Here&#8217;s my team preparing with [Jason Evanish][4] before we go out to do customer interviews. Incredibly helpful to have someone with so much experience in the field help us out.

Our startup idea was around male fashion and 2 of the mentors in attendance were founders of [Fashion Metric][6], who received angel funding from Mark Cuban in a matter of weeks after winning a prior LSM. They were excited to help us out and give practical advice about our experiments and strategy.

## Brainstorming startup ideas is fun!

With just 2 hours until the final deadline our team regrouped in a coffee shop to quickly come up with a pivot that we could go out and pitch people in Union Square. Having a group of entrepreneurial thinkers to collaborate with led to some really great ideas and a lot of fun.
